# Random Forest (RF)
Ensemble (Group of) Learning Algorithm:

It is based on Decision trees.
It can be used for both Classification and Regression.
It is Supervised Algorithm.
It creates an ensemble of Decision trees.

### Advantages of Ensemble Learning Algorithm:
Multiple Algorithms are used to find the result and out of those answer derived from most
of the Algorithms is choosen to be best.

### Disadvantages of Ensemble Learning Algorithms:
Increase in Computation time.
Slow because all Algorithm work in background one by one.

> NOTE: 'Random' keywords tells that features are divided randomly into Decision trees.

1- n-estimators: It defines the number of Decision trees in the forest.
2- max-features: It decides the maximum number of features a Decision tree can have.
